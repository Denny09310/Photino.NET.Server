# Build native, cross-platform desktop apps

Photino is a lightweight open-source framework for building native,  
cross-platform desktop applications with Web UI technology.

Photino enables developers to use fast, natively compiled languages like C#, C++, Java and more. Use your favorite development frameworks like .NET 6, and build desktop apps with Web UI frameworks, like Blazor, React, Angular, Vue, etc.!

Photino uses the OSs built-in WebKit-based browser control for Windows, macOS and Linux.
Photino is the lightest cross-platform framework. Compared to Electron, a Photino app is up to 110 times smaller! And it uses far less system memory too!

## <span>Photino.</span>NET Server

This project offers an optional static file server based on ASP.NET's Kestrel.
This is useful when you experience e. g. CORS issues or can't load JS modules directly from disk.
